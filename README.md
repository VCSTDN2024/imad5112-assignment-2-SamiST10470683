2. Project Overview
-------------------
```markdown
The Histofy App is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the IMAD5112 subject. This application was created using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The primary objective of the application is to facilitate the administration of quizzes pertaining to various civilisations across different historical periods. This enables users to enhance their knowledge of human history, receive a numerical score indicating their level of proficiency.

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilising GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.

3. App Purpose and Features
---------------------------
```markdown
Purpose:
The primary objective of this application is to facilitate users’ acquisition and assessment of knowledge pertaining to ancient civilisations and human history. It offers a total score to display the knowledge of the user pertaining to human history.

Key Features:
- Feature 1: The Histofy App offers three different civilisations to be assessed on, based on the user's input:
Input: Users specify a specific civilisation to be tested on (e.g., Ancient Egypt, Rome, Greece).
Output: The app generates a list of five questions per civilisation that the user will answer and receive feedback on (e.g., Correct, Oops... Not Quite Right)
Dynamic Suggestion: Motivational messages adjust to your progress, encouraging you to achieve your learning goals.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple ‘true’, ‘false’ and ‘next’ buttons make the experience seamless and intuitive.

- Feature 2: The Histofy app provides a personalized learning experience by tailoring quiz content based on the selected civilisation:
Contextual Quiz Content: The app tailors its quiz content to the selected civilisation, such as questions about Roman emperors for the Rome quiz and Egyptian pharaohs for the Egypt quiz.
Varied Question Delivery: Each time a user selects a civilisation, the app presents a selection of questions, offering a diverse quiz experience.
Relevant Quiz Focus: The app ensures that quiz questions are relevant and specific to the chosen civilisation.
User Engagement: Engaging, civilisation-focused quizzes enhance the learning experience.

- Feature 3: The Histofy app is designed to make historical learning simple and intuitive through seamless quiz interaction:
Civilisation Selection: Users can select from predefined civilisations, including Ancient Rome, Greece, and Egypt.
Instant Quiz Start: Upon selection, the app instantly presents a civilisation-specific quiz, minimizing delay.
Interactive Quizzing: Users engage with true/false questions and receive immediate feedback, fostering an engaging learning process.

These features are designed to provide a user-friendly and engaging platform for exploring historical knowledge related to different civilisations. The Histofy app simplifies historical learning by offering civilisation-specific quizzes, promoting focused study, and making it straightforward for users to test their understanding of significant historical facts.

4. Design Considerations
------------------------
```markdown
Design Considerations

The **Histofy App** was meticulously crafted based on these key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The app’s design prioritised an intuitive and user-friendly interface, aiming for a seamless user experience.

2. **Responsiveness**: The app was meticulously crafted to ensure optimal performance across various screen sizes, with a special focus on device compatibility.

3. **Simplicity**: The design adopts a minimalist approach, prioritising core features without overwhelming the user with excessive complexity.

4. **Performance**: Code optimization was a top priority to ensure fast response times and minimal battery consumption.
```

5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization
----------------------------------------

GitHub and GitHub Actions:

This project was managed using GitHub for version control. Regularly committed and pushed code changes allowed for collaborative coding, ensuring project integrity.

GitHub Actions was used to automate the build and deployment process. This includes running automated tests to verify app functionality, compiling the app into APK and AAB files for distribution, and uploading these build artefacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow automatically builds and tests the project every time changes are pushed, simplifying the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

7. Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------
```markdown
## Challenges and Learnings
During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: Seriously struggled to push the code to the classroom repository.
   - **Solution**: I asked my lecturer for help, and we came up with the best solution for the problem.
   
2. **Challenge 2**: Debugging the initial code in the early days of the app due to an error in the Android Manifest
   - **Solution**: Had to declare the activities: (android:name="").

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging and pushing the code to the Github repository.
```

8. Future Enhancements
----------------------
```markdown
## Future Enhancements
While the current version of the app provides core learning functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, such as:

Custom Study Plans: Allow users to create, save, and manage personalized study plans for specific historical topics or periods.
Detailed Historical Information: Link quiz questions to more in-depth historical information, including timelines, biographies, and event descriptions.
Historical Era/Topic Filtering: Add options for ancient civilisations, medieval history, world wars, and other historical categories to filter quizzes. These improvements would enhance the app’s educational value and make it even more comprehensive for users.
